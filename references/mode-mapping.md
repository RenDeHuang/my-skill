# Dual Mode Mapping

## presentation mode

- Goal: support live speaking.
- Slide text: concise bullets.
- Notes: include presenter notes (`speaker_notes`).
- Typical use: defense, internal report, conference talk.

## self_explanatory mode

- Goal: independent reading without narration.
- Slide text: denser, complete statements.
- Notes: empty by default.
- Typical use: handoff package, async review, archive deck.

## Shared constraints

- 16:9 layout
- Consistent style via theme
- Optional template pinning (`--template`)
- Image insertion from source materials when available
